# CrunchyCarrot_frontend
phase 5 capstone project

Crunchy carrots: It is a social media website where users can talk about movies with each other and leave a crunchy review on them for others to read. I chose to build this because I enjoy movies and wanted to try to implement an application with auth that is themed for movies as a centerpiece for a social media website.


User Story: 

As a user I want to be able to:

Login/ create an account (Auth) 

as the user have a way to be unique in the community like choose an avatar image and unique username

Be able to navigate between the login page, a page to add movies, and a page that shows all the movies to talk about.

Be able to make my own reviews

Be able to update those reviews 

be able to delete reviews, 

be able to respond to other user reviews 

be able to view other users profiles and add them to a list of people im following on the profile page

Stretch: 

User should be able to send friend request to other users beyond jsut following them

User could potentially digitally rent the movies or at least a fake implementation of it

User can potentially add new movies to the api for other people to review


API: I will use a non external api so I can use the CRUD easier

GET/API/Movies: this will get a current list of movies to display on the main page

Review CRUD functions:

Create/api/review should create a new review

show/api/review should show the current reviews

update/api/review should update existing reviews

Destroy/api/review should delete the review from the api

User CRUD functions:

create/api/user should should create a new user profile.

show/api/user should show the current users profils

update/api/user should allow the user to update either password profile picture or username

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
