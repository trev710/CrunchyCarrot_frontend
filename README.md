# CrunchyCarrot_frontend
phase 5 capstone project

Crunchy carrots: It is a social media website where users can talk about movies with each other and leave a crunchy review on them for others to read. I chose to build this because I enjoy movies and wanted to try to implement an application with auth that is themed for movies as a centerpiece for a social media website.


User Story: 

As a user I want to be able to:

Login/ create an account (Auth) to give the user a way to be unique in the community like choose an avatar image and unique username

Be able to navigate between the login page, a page to add movies, and a page that shows all the movies to talk about.

Be able to make my own reviews, update those reviews and delete reviews, also respond to other user reviews and be able to view other users profiles and add them to a list of people im following so I can interact with the community

Stretch: 

User should be able to send friend request to other users beyond jsut following them

User could potentially digitally rent the movies or at least a fake implementation of it

User can potentially add new movies to the api for other people to review


API: I will use a non external api so I can use the CRUD easier

GET/API/Movies: this will get a current list of movies to display on the main page

Review CRUD functions:

Create/api/review should create a new review

show/api/review should show the current reviews

update /api/review should update existing reviews

Destroy/api/review should delete the review from the api

User CRUD functions:

create/api/user should should create a new user profile.

show/api/user should show the current users profils

update/api/user should allow the user to update either password profile picture or username
