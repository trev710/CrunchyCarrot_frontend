# CrunchyCarrot_frontend
phase 5 capstone project

Crunchy carrots: It is a social media website where users can talk about movies with each other and leave a crunchy review on them for others to read. I chose to build this because I enjoy movies and wanted to try to implement an application with auth that is themed for movies as a centerpiece for a social media website.


User Story: 

As a user I want to be able to:

Login/ create an account (Auth) to give the user a way to be unique in the community

Be able to navigate between the login page, the home page, and a page that shows all the movies to talk about.

Be able to make my own reviews, update those reviews and delete reviews, also respond to other user reviews and be able to view other users profiles so I can interact with the community

Stretch: 

User should be able to send friend request to other users 

User could potentially digitally rent the movies or at least a fake implementation of it

User can potentially add new movies to the api for other people to review
